# pwf_filedialog
###### _macOS, Python 3.8.1, websockets 8.1_  
Mini project to learn how to implement a file dialog using Python with a web front-end.  

**Status:** Almost done

### About
Python app with web front-end, trying to keep it as simple as possible while learning. Front-end has just a button
and a label, when you press the button it sends a message to back-end that triggers a filedialog window, when you
select a file it then returns the filename to the front-end that displays the filename in the label.

### Disclaimer
Only tested on macOS and the code is probably not optimal as I am still learning :)
